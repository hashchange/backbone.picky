# Backbone.Picky

This is a dead repo, don't use it. 

I still keep it around because it contains a number of fixes and enhancements for the canonical [Backbone.Picky][], and those changes are referenced over there in issues and PRs.

Unfortunately, though, Backbone.Picky does not appear to be maintained any more. As an alternative, you can use [Backbone.Select][], which is a fork of Backbone.Picky (maintained by me). Backbone.Select incorporates all the fixes and improvements you see here, and more. See the [compatibility notes][picky-compatibility] for a comparison of Backbone.Select and Backbone.Picky.

You might also want to consider [Backbone.Cycle][], which layers additional functionality on top of Backbone.Select.
